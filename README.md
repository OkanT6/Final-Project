# Final-Project
Here, you can find the source code for my .NET Web API project. I developed the API for my university final project using C# and .NET Entity Framework Core, along with an MS SQL Server database. I have applied the Code First approach throughout the development process.
You can use the source code to run and test the application. To do so, you’ll need to install the required Entity Framework packages and an appropriate database provider. Additionally, ensure that you configure the database connection string in the appsettings.json file and adjust any startup configurations in the Program.cs file to match your specific setup.
# ER Diagram of the Project System
Below are the ER diagrams of the database model. This design is essential to the application, as it aligns with the project requirements and scenario. The relationships are as follows:
1-1 means one-to-one relationship
1-n means one-to-many relationship
n-n means many-to-many relationship
