# Final-Project
This is the project of my university final-project. I am developing back-end side of the project and using technologies such as C#, MS SQL Server and .Net Entity Framework Core. The output of the project will be a back-end application of the University of Erciyes's Sport Facility Reservation Application. It's called "ERU KAMPUS SPOR APPLICATON". I'm writing my own Web API on the .Net Visual Studio Environment using C# programming language.
